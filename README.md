Creating effective, interactive maps is a critical skill for anyone in the data field. Used across a wide variety of applications and fields, maps allow us to explore, understand and make decisions about our world. I build my JavaScript skills and the D3 library to create interactive maps. Used GeoJSON, a type of JSON file specifically designed to host geographical information, to develop points, linestrings, and polygons. Explore non-spatial attributes, or data that is independent of all geometric considerations, and packaged in the hierarchical structure of GeoJSON files. I create data visualizations with maps using markers such as points, circles, polygons, polylines and rectangles.
